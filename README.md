# Computational imaging calibration

VHDL design for a computational imaging calibration routine which interfaces a digital micromirror device (DMD) via an HDMI interface. An LFSR is used to project binary random binary patterns on the scene. A trigger signal is generated for the camera. Basic AXI4 implementation for the Pynq Z1 device as well as bit and hwh files are provided.
